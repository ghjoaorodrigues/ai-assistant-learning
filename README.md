# AI Assistant Systems & Real-Time Communication â€” Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal learning path into building intelligent AI assistant systems, integrating telephony (voice), and developing real-time web backends. The goal is to develop practical, deployable components that simulate the behavior of modern AI customer support and automation platforms.
